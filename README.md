# Chat Room 
 A real time chat room created by using websocket IO and node.js modules. This chat room can connect multiple users at a time on a single platform whenever a new user joins the entire group of people present in that chat room will be notified with a little ting tune. I've tried of making it a bit stylish so feel free to fork it and enchance this project. Thanks for viewing use it and let me know in the comments :)

 # Plan
 This is a project in which the basic code of HTML5, CSS3 and JS is used along with node.js and Websocket IO. All you need for this project is a cup of coffee, laptop and few steps to be followed up. Let's see that then:
 1. You need to use VSCode keeping first things first in mind that you should have a basic knowedge of what node.js and socket.io is.
 2. Moving on to the next step stop struggling with the code you have been provided a nice list of comments for each line of code, hope it helps you guys.
 3. Then most importantly remember you have to install nodemon in your nodeServer folder and make sure that set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted is enabled in your windows powershell when running as an administrator because it can give you a identification error in VSCode if this is not enabled, so please do this kindly.
 4. Stop, wait having a query ping me up in the comments below
